Here at Pare and Flourish, we are strong advocates for donating your time and skills to charity because of the endless benefits, for others and for yourself. People choose not to volunteer for different reasons. Maybe one of these has crossed your mind:

- My contribution won’t make a difference.
- I don't know where to start. 
- I’m not qualified.
- I don’t have time.

You easily can, and should, conquer any of these obstacles rather quickly. Giving back is important, after all. Why? We’re happy you asked...

## It’s good for the soul

Volunteering gives you new perspective on your personal life. You meet new people, learn new skills, and push yourself outside of your comfort zone. **You get a chance to look past what the world has to offer you, and find what you have to offer instead.**

You’ll find unexpected benefits, for example, a decrease in depression, or an increase in energy; at least that’s what we’ve experienced.

There is nothing like the feeling you get when you are helping someone without expecting anything in return. Maybe you’re helping a community of people or a school. You will see and feel the direct impact you’re having on the lives of others. It’ll make your heart happy, guaranteed. 

## It’s good for the community

This one’s pretty obvious, right? Donating your time is good for the people you’re helping, but what isn’t as obvious is that it helps the local economy. **Even when money isn’t exchanged, your contribution of time goes a long way for your community’s financial state.** For example, a park beautification project can lead to more tourism. A nonprofit festival generates income for the local vendors who participate. The list goes on.

## It’s good for the company

Your company is looking for new ways to stand out. If they aren’t, they should be. In a world of corporate culture, your company’s contributions will not go unnoticed. Your initiative in suggesting the idea or taking part in some way won’t fly under the radar either. **Everyone wins in this situation: the company becomes more trustworthy, you feel good about contributing, and the community reaps the benefits.**

## It’s good for the resume

We don't love the idea of volunteering just for the resume line, but it is an added benefit. It will come as no surprise that employers love to hire people who are active in their community. **It shows that the person is well-rounded and takes initiative beyond the baseline of what must be done.** If you are working on building your professional brand, this is a great way to build a strong reputation.
