Admittedly, the P&F team spends more time on the road than we’d like. Between the commute to our day jobs, our [Flourish Roundtables](/events), our family, our friends, and our commitments, it’s piling up.

We’re becoming experts on the commute and how to survive it.

This isn’t to say that we don’t appreciate a long drive with the windows down and the music up; that’s therapeutic in its own way. Sometimes, though, your day needs a more productive boost. You know, the days when you don’t have time to fit it all in. “It” being self-care, personal realizations, learning, and reading.

When we need something meaningful to fill our long drives, we turn to...

Want to feel accomplished? “Read” an entire book on your drive. You’ll feel productive before your day even starts. If you’re listening to one of the books on our [reading list](/reading-list) you’ll likely feel inspired, too. There’s nothing like realizing you’ve already “read” a whole book to make your commute feel meaningful.

You’ll be walking into your day with a clear headspace. Especially when the narrator’s voice is as soothing as [Elizabeth Gilbert’s](https://amzn.to/2HmJ0O7). Need a [book suggestion](/reading-list)? We’ve got you covered.

## Mindfulness Practices

We recently learned a bit about mindfulness practices, from [Alice Simpson of 4Yoga](/blog/meet-alice/), and how they can be used to reduce stress. There are times when a long day at work and long commute can use a bit of silence. Using this time to be silent can be just what you need to feel calm. 

A mindfulness practice we love: Observation is a great way to calm your mind. Notice what’s around you, without placing judgement on or reacting to it. This can be sights, sounds, your own breath—anything you sense. Notice what’s happening and suddenly everything melts away.

## Phone Calls

To your spouse. To your parents. To your best friend. To your siblings. 

These calls put your life back in balance. Using this time to catch up with your friends and family reaffirms your connection. Life makes a little more sense after listening to what your grandma cooked for breakfast this morning. 

*Disclaimer: Pay attention while you drive! Use hands-free calling.*

How do you spend your commute?
