Humans don’t have consistent workflow. Some days you’re swamped, others you’re swimming in downtime and it feels unproductive. As always, we have a few suggestions.

## Read

Reading is our favorite. Whether fiction or nonfiction, a good book has a way of capturing you. You can escape, or learn, or laugh, or all three. 

We use reading a way to motivate ourselves or to connect over common ideas. For example, we share an Audible account and can talk about our mutual reads when we’re done. It tends to ground us in the present. 

You can find some of our favorites here on our [reading list](/reading-list/).

## Continued Education

Required or not, continued education is a great way to step up your career game. Not only does it improve your skill set, but also shows that you give a shit about what you’re doing. It’s a big flashy sign to your boss that you’re willing to use your Facebook scrolling time to better yourself and the company.

Continued education can also be sought after for personal gains. Looking to specialize in an area? Looking to transition jobs? Want to learn a new skill for the hell of it? Continued education is an easy way to make your move in a pragmatic way.

## Networking

Networking is a critical factor in the success of your career. We talk about this a lot. A lot. 

How you network depends on your personal style and preferences, as well as your industry. We tend to network in two ways: 

### 1. Intentionally Networking with one Person

It tends to be easier to personally reach out to someone you want to connect with, if you want to expand your network. This method can also create more meaningful working relationships.

### 2. Group networking events

Group networking events can take the pressure off you to make small talk. Instead, focus on meeting a wide range of people. Check out our [Flourish Roundtable Events](/events/) to see how we changed the way we network.

## Help Out

When you find yourself with some free time, take a look around. Is everyone else busy? Use this time to collaborate with your team and offer to help carry a piece of their workload. This simple act of kindness can go a long way for your coworker relationships. 

How do you use your downtime?
