You’ve networked, you’ve volunteered, you’ve conquered. So far, we’ve talked a lot about professional development. We’re taking a break from that to recognize the importance of self-care—just as you should take a break from the stress that comes from being a young professional, navigating life.

If you're not taking care of yourself, you will undoubtedly lose steam and slowly burn out. We’re so focused on moving forward, that we’re afraid of losing precious time to be productive. But by practicing self-care, you’re fueling your ambition and increasing your mental and physical endurance.

It's important to perform well and show that you’re an asset, but not at the expense of your mental and physical health. If you burn your candle at both ends, you may realize that you’re underperforming. In the words of the great Ron Swanson, “Give 100%. 110% is impossible. Only idiots recommend that.”

Here are some ways to take a more mindful, peaceful approach to your week:

<hr class="secondary">

## 1. Find the positives. 

Positive thinking is something that even the happiest of people struggle with. But think small. Your car started, you remembered to pack an umbrella, and your grandma called to see how you were. Whatever happened in your day, search for the good. No one thinks positively every minute of their day. So, make an effort to surround yourself with positive people to remind you of the good things—even when you can’t see them.

## 2. Treat yo'self.

Speaking of finding the positives: we were able to relate, not one, but two, Parks and Rec references to this topic.  

The ideal treat looks different to everyone (e.g. Ben’s Batman suit). For us, this blog is our way of treating ourselves. Having an hour or two of creative time in our day gives us the good vibes we need to be positive. And massages. You can't possibly be negative after a massage. Maybe yours is a nice meal at that restaurant you usually won’t spend the money on, or maybe a coffee. Whatever it is, do it for yourself.

## 3. Do nothing.

When was the last time you did nothing? Really think about that. It can be a hard concept to grasp in the age of technology. When your mom calls and says “Hey! What are you doing?” and you say “nothing” but you’re really watching tv and/or scrolling through Facebook or Twitter? Yeah, that doesn’t count. 

You need time to be alone, to reflect and let your mind wander. Sit outside with a hot cup of tea and really look around you. Notice things that you don’t bother to glance up at anymore. You owe it to yourself to recharge.

Don’t let the stressors of the world blow out your candle. Spend this week trying to implement self-care at least once. What is your favorite self-care practice?
