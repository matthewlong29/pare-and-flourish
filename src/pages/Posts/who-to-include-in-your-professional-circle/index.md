In a time of need, you want people you can run to with your questions. It’s time to add those people to your professional circle. 

You can easily start a [networking or referral group (see “Join a Referral Group”)](/blog/pitching-your-professional-brand-a-guide-for-introverts/) that fits your needs. The question is, who should you ask?

## 1. Communicate, Communicate, Communicate 

No matter the industry, all businesses need content. That content can be useful in a variety of ways: on a website, in policies, on a marketing campaign, etc. Communication is the root of every organization. You need to tell the world what you’re doing before people will understand your service. Behind the scenes, you need people to communicate within your business for operations to run smoothly.

Surround yourself with professionals who can write your policies and procedures, or create an email campaign, or design a branding logo. With these people in your circle, you will cover your bases on all things communication: 

- Technical Writer
- Email/Social Media Marketer
- Graphic Designer

## 2. Keep Your Mind on Your Money

In business and in life, it’s important to keep your money in order. After all, it’s not about how much money you have, but how you use it. You may know all there is to know about your field, but who will help you choose accounts for your 401k? 

Few people will find that finances come easy to them. Have someone in your corner who knows what’s best for you and your hard-earned cash. Here are a few people who can help you keep your accounts in order:

- Accountant
- Banker
- Financial Advisor

## 3. Computers and You

What can’t computers do these days? We’ve automated our lives to an extreme, but convenient, point. Thanks to computers, we can work with anyone, anywhere, anytime. But one thing computers can’t do is fix themselves, develop new programs on their own, and run new websites. 

Luckily, we have [Matt Long](http://www.mtlong.me/) —our website developer. Without Matt, this blog wouldn’t exist. Your business will need IT help from the moment it’s launched. If not your business, you will one day need help with your personal computer. Make friends with one, or all, of these people right now: 

- IT Specialist
- Web Developer
- Software Developer

## 4. Check Yo’self—Before You Wreck Yo’self

We always need someone looking out for us. At times we follow laws that we don’t necessarily understand. For example, when you start a business… You suddenly need to follow business laws so as to not make money illegally. You need people advising you on what to do and what you need to protect you from legal discourse. 

And then there’s your insurance agent, who is also keeping you out of legal issues. Buying insurance is often intimidating. It’s helpful to know to someone who can explain the pros and cons for different personal and business options. You need to quickly befriend these two people:  

- Attorney
- Insurance Agent

Meeting and connecting with people in these specialized areas can go a long way. You are no longer at the mercy of customer service or overpaying for advice. Do you think we missed any?
