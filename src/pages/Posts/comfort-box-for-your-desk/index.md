Working a 9-to-5 type of job makes your desk a home base for you. You spend almost as much time there, or at least in the office, as you do at your home. If you’re spending 40+ hours there per week, then wouldn’t you agree that your desk should be a very comfortable space?

We’ve put together a few items to create a comfort box—a box that will hold everything you need to make yourself comfortable or to get yourself out of a pinch. Have you ever been in dire need of nail clippers and no one in the office has any? You need a comfort box.

What should be in your box?

**[1. b+b Dye-Free Ibuprofen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072TZ43DR/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pareandflouri-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B072TZ43DR&linkId=bbfe959c6d39018683c32ab5ce8c7504)**

  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6">
    <p>We chose this brand specifically because if you buy a pack, this company gives a pack to a person in need. b+b has removed all dyes and only uses quality FDA/USDA approved ingredients. Even its packaging goes above average and uses less plastic to be better for the environment.</p>

**[2. Neutrogena Skin Clearing Blemish Concealer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075X191YX/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pareandflouri-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B075X191YX&linkId=193e9c7b3e79019572a2065f4b3ca850)**

  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6">
    <p>Should you care what your skin looks like? No, we definitely support you loving yourself unconditionally, zits and all. But for us, having a blemish on our face makes it difficult to concentrate on anything else. This is a perfect solution to cover acne, help it heal, and forget it exists. Get back to thinking about important things.</p>

**[3. Manicure Pedicure Set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078YQW3RN/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pareandflouri-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078YQW3RN&linkId=bacfabf48dca785e9aa66b28c663f85a)**

  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6">
    <p>Hangnails come out of nowhere. You never expect to deal with this issue, and you usually don’t, until it happens and no one has anything you need. Cover your bases and get a manicure pedicure set that prepares you for any nail-related situation.</p>

  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6">
    <p>Katie swears by this hand sanitizer. The strong, perfume-y smell of other sanitizers is nauseating for some. Clean your hands and relax with this aromatherapy stress relief version for Bath and Body Works</p>

**[5. Hand Cream by The Body Shop](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OB87KKK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pareandflouri-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00OB87KKK&linkId=e338ea7aa9fbd316eaa89346e4b24618)**

  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6">
    <p>Skylar is in love with products from The Body Shop lately, and happens to also have dry skin. It drives her insane in the middle of the day and is even painful at times. You can be prepared with this small lotion that smells amazing.</p>

**[6. Contigo Reusable Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YYBBYN8/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pareandflouri-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00YYBBYN8&linkId=d321e2151c8b4a9670e17f65594880c6)**

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6">
    <p>Unless your office has glasses you can use, bring a water bottle. Staying hydrated will help balance your mood and keep you feeling healthy throughout the day. We also have a habit of feeling hungry when we’re actually just thirsty. A water bottle will keep all of these symptoms away.</p>
  </div>

**[7. Sony Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NJ2M33I/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pareandflouri-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00NJ2M33I&linkId=1b2d3ebc2245ce71f343410d41961049)**

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6">
    <p>Cut out the office noise with headphones. Some days, office chatter is exactly what you want. Other times, you need isolating silence to get that project out the door.</p>

Take your time creating this and add to it as you go. We didn’t exhaust this list, so there’s much more ground to cover (tampons, for example). Personalize this to your heart’s content and we promise, you’ll be living a much more comfortable life at work.
