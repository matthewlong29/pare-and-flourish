A little about Andrea:

    <blockquote>“I'm a wife and stay at home mom of two small children, one of whom has Autism. I spend what little free time I have working on building my businesses through social media and coming up with new designs for products. I love what I do, as I have always loved being creative since I was a little girl. I also am motivated to succeed in my business because I want to help support my family, as they are my whole world.” - Andrea</blockquote>

## How would you describe your brand?

I would describe my brand as being about positivity, inspiration, women and moms. I do have some products for men, but the majority is for women. I like to create products that make people happy or make them laugh. I also like to create products that are relatable to people.

## What is your inspiration for your designs?

I tend to find inspiration from things I can relate to. As a mom, I love wearing t-shirts with cute and quirky messages, so I find myself creating them as well. I used to be an art teacher, so I also find myself designing a lot of shirts geared toward teachers. Teachers love cute t-shirts!

## What are you most proud of when it comes to your business?

Blessed Societee is less than a year old, but I started my first Etsy shop in 2010. I closed it within a few weeks because I had no idea what I was doing. In 2015, I reopened it with the determination in me that I would figure out how to be successful on Etsy. I’m very proud of myself that I kept at it.  I didn’t really sell much for the first year. I did a lot of online research on how to make it work. I learned about items people actually wanted to buy, and I figured out what was easiest for me to create and sell with the little time I had on my hands. I was a new mom at the time and life was very hectic, but somehow I made it work. Today my first Etsy shop is really successful. I have almost 3000 sales, and over 500 positive reviews. I’m looking forward to making Blessed Societee a huge success as well. I’m really proud of myself for not giving up!

## What was the 'ah-ha' moment when you decided to start your own business?

I don’t know if I had a single “ah ha” moment, but rather a series of them. Back to my first Etsy shop, ANABDesign, I first tried to sell 8x10 inch digital prints. They didn’t sell well at all. So, I realized I had to make a change. Since people weren’t buying my digital products, I decided I needed to sell a physical product. So, I decided on note cards, because I could design them, make them easily, and they’d also be simple to ship. 
 
I invested in a nice printer, figured out where to get nice cardstock, and the note card era of ANABDesign was born, and it was very successful! One of my cards was even featured on Buzzfeed.  When I had my second child, I knew I would no longer have time to print and ship the physical note cards. It was time to change yet again, so ANABDesign turned back into a digital shop, but this time, I sold printable invitations and party games.  
 
It was a huge success and still is today. With all of the success of my first shop, I really missed creating a physical product, and I really missed designing t-shirts like I did in the past for Zazzle and Café Press. So, I did some more internet research, and found that I could start a t-shirt shop with production partners, who could take care of the physical product for me that I didn’t have time to do. That’s how Blessed Society, now Blessed Societee, began.

## What advice do you have for people who want to go for it and start something of their own?

To not give up, especially in the beginning! It’s really hard work starting a business. There are a lot of things you have to learn. You have to stay organized. You have to have a plan of what you want to accomplish. Write down your goals, and look at them often. I have two Etsy shops, and it’s a lot of work, but it’s really worth it. I love being able to work when I want to and be my own boss.  

## What are three things you would go back and tell yourself at the beginning, if you could?

1. Take your time. It doesn’t all have to be done today. You don’t have to figure everything out at once. Take your time with your products. I used to try to create things quickly.  What I didn’t realize was that, if I had slowed down, the designs I made could have been so much better. When I had my first child, he really made me slow down. I got really frustrated at the time because I couldn’t just sit down and make something. There was a lot of stop and go.  But what I found was that, after I was away from my project for a while, when I came back to look at it sometime later, I saw things I wanted to change and make better. So, I think my son slowing me down was really a blessing in disguise, and it’s probably one of the reasons I started getting more sales.

2. Invest in your business. I think it’s true that you have to spend some money to make money.  A long time ago, before I was ever really serious at all about starting a business, I did a lot of print on demand work for websites like Café Press and Zazzle (I still use Zazzle, I love Zazzle!). Back then, I would never even consider paying for resources such as fonts, or graphic packs. I would search the internet, and waste my time looking for free resources. One day I found a website that offered a ton of graphics with an unlimited commercial license for about $34. I thought, “Ugh, I can’t buy that.” But then, I stopped myself and thought, “Why not?” So I bought it, and now I’m all about spending some money on things that will help me improve my designs and products.

3. Don’t be afraid to let your business grow and change into something else. Trends and styles change, and you have to change with them, or else your products become dull and don’t sell. 

## What qualities make you a good entrepreneur?

I have a lot of determination to make my ideas work. I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way, and I’m sure I will make a ton more, but I’m not going to give up. I was an elementary art teacher for 5 years. I loved my career. I went to college and earned a degree in Art Education and then I received my master’s degree in Gifted Ed. So, I was really into my career.  
 
Due to chronic health issues, such as a bladder disease that I was born with, Interstitial Cystitis, and Fibromyalgia, I had to leave my job. I just physically could not do it anymore. I don’t think I could physically do any full time job anymore, but I can work from home! I can be creative at my computer, and I have great production partners who help me with the finished products. That’s one of the reasons this is so important to me. I want to provide for my family the best way I know that I can, and I get to love what I do at the same time. So, success is the only option for me.
