My original intention was to write SEVEN parts of a mini series--one per month. I wrote four. I thought that I would have enough time, energy, and inspiration for such a thing. Really, it’s a testament to how I have zero concept of time. 

Luckily, I didn’t write everything I had hoped because I was too busy. Too busy living life and finding a balance between normalcy and excitement in France. 

Therefore, I’m not going to apologize for not writing much. To my family and friends who hoped to follow my journey more closely: I’ll tell you all about it when I get home. It’s better in person. Over coffee. Promise. 

Narrowing this entire experience down to just a few lessons is difficult, but I will do my best. 

The ten things I took away from this experience are…

### 1. Never take “adulting” for granted. 

Working with teenagers reminded me that navigating life at that age is hard. You have little control over what your parents think is best for you, but you’re trying to learn your identity. Those two things rarely mix. 

As an adult, you have the power to go where you want and do what you want, within your financial boundaries, of course. This is the type of freedom you dream about for years as a teenager, if you have to make it through a bills before you get there, so be it. 

### 2. Teenagers can be wiser than you think.

When asked “What was the biggest life lesson you learned this year?” a girl answered, “I had a relationship for two years. It’s over now, but it was a good experience that I’m glad I had.” The amount of emotional intelligence it takes to end a relationship and view it as a good experience wasn’t something I expected from a 17 year old. 

### 3. Do something that scares the sh*t out of you at least once a year.

I set out to have some “firsts.” Last year, that meant starting a business. This year, it meant going to Morocco and getting a tattoo, not at the same time. Traveling to a country outside of Europe was far outside my comfort zone. Likewise, having a permanent image etched into my skin with a needle was also not included in things I find comfortable. I’m happy I did both. 

### 4. The desire to travel never goes away. It gets more intense.

The more I push my travel comfort zone, the more I’m capable of doing. The more I’m capable of doing, the more I’m dying to see.

### 5. Focus on people in the moment.

Both of my stints in France brought me to people I love so much and people I feel like I’ve known my entire life. I’ve decided that’s because here I have time. Time to talk about every single part of a person’s life over wine. Time to learn and share their interests. Time to have new experiences you can bond over. 

While I won’t have this kind of time when I return to the US, I definitely want to make an effort to pay more attention and ask thoughtful questions. 

### 6. Read something outside your wheelhouse.

Having more time on my hands than usual on planes, trains, etc., I looked for books I wouldn’t normally read. For perspective, books I would normally read are autobiographies of my favorite comedians; I was going through a very specific phase. 

I picked up two books on how poverty affects women in underdeveloped countries ([Half the Sky](https://amzn.to/2Hj7T1V) & [The Blue Sweater](https://amzn.to/2Hm8z6L)), one about creativity ([Big Magic](https://amzn.to/2HFVvs8)), and another about the evolution of religion ([God: A Human History](https://amzn.to/2Hit4Bf)). They’re all fantastic and I’ve learned much more than I would have while sticking to my very specific autobiographies. 

### 7. Don’t let a fear of boasting keep you from sharing your experiences with other people.

Yes, you risk sounding, for lack of a better word, douchey. You’re going to be sitting with your friends and “that one time in Morocco” is going to be the perfect story to tell at that moment. Tell it. 

### 8. Saying “no” is extremely important.

I remind myself of this lesson at least once a year. You might say that I never truly learn this lesson because I have to relearn it over and over and over again. Saying “yes” to everything, even if the thing I’m saying “yes” to will negatively affect me, is my biggest flaw. I think I’m one tiny step closer to finding that balance this year. 

### 9. If a spa offers you a free hamam, understand that you will be almost completely naked, lying on a heated slab of rock.

This needs no further explanation. Research spa treatments before you agree to them. 

### 10. Taking time to yourself isn’t selfish.

You’re the only person who can protect your mental state. If that means shutting yourself in a room for the day to read and think, do that. If that means spending some time working on a personal project and not sharing it, do that too. Anything you need to do to balance yourself, do it.

At a certain point in the fall, I felt selfish for taking this opportunity. I’m so glad I got out of that mindset. If anything, I got to share this special part of my life with so many people from home and I’ll be returning with a very positive attitude.

### 11. Bonus: The best part of any trip is the food and the people.

The end.
