Hi! My name is Dominique Hendren and food is my passion. I could talk about it all day long to anyone who would listen. The problem, however, is getting people to actually listen, and to question what they are eating and why.

Nutrition conjures up words like “diet,” “overweight,” or “unhealthy.” It’s a vicious cycle, but is poorly understood and oftentimes misrepresented. My goal here is to provide clarity, which should then spark some questions.

**I want you to question what you are eating and why.** Ask yourself if it is serving you in any tangible way and how you can better position yourself for the future.

## The Most Common Health Complaints.

When I talk with people, the general health complaints are the following:

- I am generally unhappy with my health.
- I am tired.
- I do not sleep enough and when I do it is not well.
- I am not drinking enough water.
- I know I am not healthy. 
- I just can’t get anything to work.
- I am on pain medication.
- My thinking is foggy.
- My body aches.

If we’re eating foods that are toxic to our systems, we are generally unhappy and unhealthy. We don’t sleep enough, and when we do sleep, it is poor. We are not hydrated, we are overweight, and we have a range of emotional issues.

As a society, we are struggling to understand nutrition and how it contributes to our mental and physical wellness. Since it is such a complex topic, it is no surprise that people simply don’t know where to turn, how to turn, and when to turn.

I can spot a person that needs to detoxify from a mile away: I see it in their eyes, their skin, the health of their hair. Food is not only a weight issue. It is much deeper than that.

## Food Marketing Manipulation.

Do you ever see a coupon for fresh broccoli? Well no, because that does not bring in money. There is simply no “business” in the growing and purchasing of real food, so an entire marketing decision has been made to entice the consumer into believing that this is better, faster, and saving them money. But is that true?

I watch as people legitimately try to eat well: they read the boxes and make sure they are checking off the right words that include “natural,” “fat-free,” “gluten-free,” etc. Those selling words are placed in just the right spot to grab our attention and trick us into thinking that we are making good choices. If you only knew how much attention and money goes into the wording, marketing, and advertising on food boxes.

The media seizes upon our society’s weaknesses. They tempt us with perfect bodies (that are altered by PhotoShop), “reduced” this and that, and delivery food right to your door. They lead us to believe that IF we buy and eat their product, our results will be what we see in their advertisement. As many of you know, this is not the case.

## Food and its Partner—Emotion.

When we are joyful we celebrate with food and when we are sad we turn to food. Both emotions are strong and have powerful results. What you eat is directly linked to how you feel, how you manage your stress and how you accomplish the tasks required of you each day.

The old saying, “you are what you eat,” really is true. If you eat garbage, then your body and mind will eventually respond in a negative way. Of course, if you eat well (and this doesn’t have to mean fancy) then your body and mind will respond positively.

## If You Don’t Use It, You Lose It.

If all you eat is chemical laden, preservative-filled fast food, restaurant food, or things in a box, you must understand that this is not food. It is fabricated to taste good to your addictive sensors and once you are hooked, like a cigarette, you yearn for more. The crucial point is to educate yourself and understand the difference between the good and not so good.

Lost is the natural occurrence of tasting the herbs that might accompany the vegetable or the olive oil, lightly drizzled over a perfect tomato with a touch of cracked pepper. Our mouths have lost the ability, because for so long we have told our sensors they can’t taste anything that is not processed! When you stop using a part of your body, it atrophies—palette, mouth, tongue, brain.

## It’s a Big, Achievable Change. Here’s How to Start. 

What is so often the case is that this whole food discussion is a big one and overwhelms even the best of us. Let’s break it down into small steps – essentially one baby step at a time of things you can do to improve your health daily.

Start with shopping. 

1. Shop the outer aisles of the grocery store.
2. Decide you will not even walk through the cereal aisle (it’s not food- but it sure makes a lot of money for the companies that produce it).
3. See how many fruits and vegetables you can find that are green, yellow, orange, or red, and encourage your children (if you have any) to do this with you. 
4. Pull back on one thing each time you go shopping. Instead of always buying milk or cheese, decide that this time you won’t. Try Almond milk instead.
5. Walk past the soda aisle. Yep…just keep walking. Get water instead and add sliced lemons or limes.

We are offered bountiful food options in this country . All we must do is look at the color wheel of fresh food and the rest will follow.

## The Challenge of Control. The Joy of Finding It.

We already, as a society, object to our lack of control over things. What we eat is ONE area where we do have full control. We need to step back and take our food decisions into our own hands. Meal time does not need to be a big production, but it needs to be clean. Clean of advertisement, boxes, and sauces in a packet. We deserve this and should expect this from ourselves.

*I encourage you to challenge yourself and walk through a grocery store shopping the perimeter and steering clear of the packaged goods. See the glorious colors that nature provides — avocado, squash, tomato, onion, garlic, ginger, spinach, kale — and put it in the cart if it appeals to you. Then, saunter over to the meat department and request hormone, antibiotic free beef, chicken, pork etc. Again, put it in your cart. Go home and lay it out on the counter.*

It is from here that we start. When food is simple and clean, cooking it is simple and, well, clean.
