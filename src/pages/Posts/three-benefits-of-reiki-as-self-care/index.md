We live in a world of go, go, go. When do we stop and take time for ourselves? Do you wait until you hit a wall and then realize you need a break? To explain this, we say “I don’t have enough time.”

Our body, mind, and spirit need us to slow down and be present to heal and de-stress. How can one heal if you are constantly low on energy? What does that do to your physical, mental, and emotional health?

There are many ways to stop and “take time.” Some people journal, meditate, or take a relaxing bath. I invite you to think about another way to relax, heal, and reconnect—Reiki.

Reiki is a technique for stress reduction and relaxation that encourages emotional and physical healing. It is a natural alternative therapy practiced all over the world.

Reiki is based on the principle of life force energy. This energy is present in every living thing. We are surrounded by energy that we cannot see, but we can feel. Low energy can produce illness and stress while a balanced energy can promote health and wellbeing.

## What Exactly is a Reiki Session? 

Some describe Reiki as an energy massage. The practitioner and client will discuss if there are specific goals for that session. Maybe the client is there to focus on reducing stress or more specifically, an ailment or injury.

The client lies on a table, fully clothed, apart from socks and shoes. Clients can choose whether the reiki practitioner’s hands hover over the body or lay on the body directly. The client is relaxed and welcome to meditate, pray, fall asleep, or whatever feels good to them in that moment.

As a Reiki Practitioner, I love to incorporate essential oil and to burn white sage in the session. I feel this allows for an even deeper healing experience. 

## Benefits of Reiki

### 1. Stress Reduction and Relaxation

Imagine lying on a table, with your eyes closed, and not having a care in the world while someone balances the energy in your body. You don’t have to do a thing! You must only be open to your healing, relax, and receive.

Taking action to take care of yourself for that moment is amazing in itself. You are saying yes to yourself: mind, body, and spirit.

We take in so much of everyone else’s energies throughout our daily lives. Whether you are at home, work, or the store there are other energies around you. They can be loving energies or stressful ones. These energies stick with us and affect our mood and health.

Reiki is a tool to clear those stressful energies and bring us back into balance and harmony with ourselves.

### 2. Encourages Emotional and Physical Healing

Reiki can work in conjunction with other medical and therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. In addition to your medical physician, reiki can be a helpful addition to your recovery.  

During a session, the Reiki Practitioner focuses on each energy chakra (which are part of the energetic body) as well as any other parts of the body that need healing. When a chakra point is low in energy, it can create stress and make your body more susceptible to “dis-ease”. While a physician works to heal the physical aspects of your body, reiki focuses on the emotional, energetic and spiritual aspects which, in turn, supports physical healing.

Reiki allows you to be an active participant in your health and well-being because you’re taking care of the whole person.

### 3. Connection to Your Own Personal Spirit

During a Reiki session, I encourage each person to connect with what they believe: God, light energy, the universe, angels; all are welcome.

As your energies are being healed and lifted, you can go deeper into your spiritual self. Your heart, mind, and body can embrace this moment and shut down everything going on outside that session room. This is your time!

As a Reiki Practitioner, I not only focus on my clients, I use this tool for self-healing.  It has helped me stay connected to my own body and energy.  I am more aware of who I truly am and what my mind, body, and spirit are saying to me.  When we are connected we can be more proactive in self-care. What does your mind, body, and spirit need at this moment?
