Quitting a job can be bittersweet. It’s a whirlwind of emotions—from the excitement of a new opportunity to the nostalgia of leaving your closest work friends behind. While you may feel the urge to go out with a bang, logic will tell you not burn any bridges. The best way to keep that mutual respect when resigning is to write a resignation letter. 

A resignation letter explains when and why you're leaving. The simple act of turning in a resignation letter implies that you are not leaving your employer high and dry. Let’s call it an act of good faith. 

When writing a resignation letter, there are a few things that you should keep in mind. We’ll walk you through the steps.

## Be Direct

Your letter shouldn’t be too long. When you resign, you want it to be straight to the point.

<p class="indent">Dear (insert HR department manager),</p>
<p class="indent">I am writing to inform you of my resignation from (insert company name), effective (insert date at least two weeks out).</p>

## Be Formal and Respectful

Now is not the time to throw shade at your employer. After all, that would give them written proof of unprofessional conduct. A resignation letter should be written in the same tone as a cover letter: gracious and respectful.

<p class="indent">This was not an easy decision to make. I appreciate your team for teaching me (insert lessons learned here).</p>

## Be Honest

Your employer deserves to know the real reason you’re resigning. HR takes that information and (hopefully) uses it to improve their company. Now is also not the time to throw out accusations of who is at fault for your desire to quit. Be honest, but be modest.

<p class="indent">Ultimately, (insert company name here) and I were not a good fit. I am leaving to (insert the reason you are leaving here).</p>

## Be Gracious

Be sure to thank your employer for the opportunities you were given. They took a chance on you and invested time and money into your development. It’s important that they know you’re grateful.

<p class="indent">I’ve enjoyed working with your staff. Thank you for providing me with opportunities for professional growth. If i can be of any help during this transition, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

Finally, we have created a resignation letter that reads as follows:

<p class="indent">Dear (insert HR department manager),</p>
<p class="indent">I am writing to inform you of my resignation from (insert company name), effective (insert date at least two weeks out).</p>
<p class="indent">This was not an easy decision to make. I appreciate your team for teaching me (insert lessons learned here). Ultimately, (insert company name here) and I were not a good fit. I am leaving to (insert the reason you are leaving here).</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve enjoyed working with your staff. Thank you for providing me with opportunities for professional growth. If i can be of any help during this transition, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>
<p class="indent">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="indent">(Insert your name here)</p>
