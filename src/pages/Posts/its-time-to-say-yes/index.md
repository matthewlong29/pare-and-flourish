*Start with a 'Yes,' and see where that takes you.* - Tina Fey, Bossypants

Tina Fey knows what she’s talking about. We love reading creative nonfiction books like [Bossypants](http://amzn.to/2xoZGnV) because we get the opportunity to peer into the lives of those we admire. They are writing a letter, of sorts, straight to the reader that says this is how I got here. You get to pick and choose the advice that applies to your own situation and set your compass accordingly.

One of our many takeaways from this book was to say **yes** and see where it takes you. You never know what’s waiting on the other side of that response. Aren’t you dying to find out? 

We compiled a list of things you should say yes to. Let’s see what you think.

## 1. A Networking Event

We wouldn’t be living by our Pare and Flourish compass, if we didn't tell you attend a networking event. Networking events have unforeseen advantages. They give you the opportunity to meet new people, learn about new careers, and step outside of your comfort zone.

## 2. A New Project

Are you feeling a void in your life? Are you not feeling creative enough or happy enough in your day to day? Start a project that excites you. Create your own purpose and do what you love most, whatever that may be. You’ll be surprised how much more stable you’ll feel.

## 3. A New Hobby

Hobbies are fantastic for unwinding at night and on the weekends. The more time you spend doing something that you love, the more content and balanced you’ll feel. When your friends ask you to rock climb, or cook, or go wine tasting, say yes! This may be your new outlet.

## 4. An Informational Interview

We’re relentless with this networking, huh? Because it works to your advantage. Informational interviews are the perfect way to meet people and learn at the same time. If you are considering changing careers, meet with someone who is successful in the field you want to enter. If you are hoping to start a nonprofit or join a board, meet with someone who has done just that. You’ll find that people love sharing information, most times. It never hurts to ask.

## 5. A Day Off Work

We often talk to people who say that they don’t use all of their vacation days. This is more of a management issue than anything. Employees should be required to take time off work for their mental health. You need days to recenter, no matter how much you like your work. Take your vacation days. You essentially get paid to take care of yourself or visit a friend or relative. Work can wait.

## 6. A Companion

It’s always a good time for a new companion. We aren’t suggesting you go out and adopt five pets, or anything like that; however, the feeling of taking in a homeless animal is indescribable. The P&F team all have our own furry best friends. We wouldn’t change a thing. I think we all agree that our pets have done wonders for our stress and anxiety.

## 7. A New Career

If you’re lucky, you may already love your job. In which case, skip right over this one. 

However, if you find yourself consistently dreading Mondays, maybe you should look into a career change. A change of scenery may be just what you need. If you find your LinkedIn Mail full of recruiting emails, this could be very easy. Say ‘yes’ to hearing one of them out. You never know where this could lead you. It could lead you right into your dream job, with a better work environment and better pay.

## 8. A New Place To Live

Moving sounds scary; it’s a new place where you don’t know the best route to the grocery or the best place to eat dinner. Basic tasks become harder because you’re no longer surrounded by your favorite grocery store, car wash, bank, etc. While that’s true, moving has plenty of benefits that surpass any of the drawbacks. 

A new city gives you the chance to make new friends, a new professional network, new volunteer opportunities, new job opportunities, and so much more. You get a brand new start. Take advantage! 

## 9. An Adventure of a Lifetime

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8 col-xs-12">
    <p>When presented with an opportunity that’s outside of your comfort zone, go for it. It will not be “the right time” because it is never the right time. Go out and make things happen for yourself. It is too easy to talk yourself out of something like a big adventure because there are so many perfect reasons to walk away: not enough money, not enough time, not ready to leave a steady career, etc.</p>
    <p>Those are good things to consider but, ultimately, we encourage you to say yes and work out the logistics later. It just may take you exactly where you want to go, or it will give you something you didn’t even know you wanted.</p>

The next opportunity that presents itself, say yes! See where it takes you. What have you said “yes” to recently? How did it go?
