Disclaimer: We were terrified of writing this blog. We wanted to, but had a lot of hesitations. Namely, who are we to inform people about their careers? What if people don’t like it? What if we aren’t good at it? 
 
The answers to those questions: People become experts through research and sharing info. Who cares if people don’t like something you are doing to help other people. We weren’t good at it, and it’s still an uphill battle. 
 
Now that we’ve put away our egos and just started, it’s the best thing we could have done for ourselves. We’ve also helped a few people along the way. This blog has empowered us to do other things in our lives and careers that we were also afraid to do. 
 
Here are a few things you’ll gain from writing your own blog about whatever it is you’re passionate about: 

### Connections

A secret, huge blogging community exists. Once you start connecting with Facebook groups, bloggers in your area, and bloggers who write about the same topics you do, you’ll quickly see that there is no limit to the resources. 
 
You can find people who are at any stage of their blogs; you can make connections with people who have successfully built their blogs or with people at your stage of the process. Most often, everyone is ready to share their successes and failures to help you however they can. 

### A Reason to Research Your Interests

No matter how much you know about your topic, there’s always room to grow. We take topics from our everyday lives as inspiration for articles, but that doesn’t quite cut it. 
 
The blog has given us the opportunity to read books about ideas we’re interested in from industry professionals. It’s given us the opportunity to use new products (so far, networking and project management apps) that help us write content for the blog, but also help us in our day-to-day lives. 

### A Way to Learn Marketable Skills

Writing a blog sounded easier in the beginning than it actually turned out to be. Originally, we thought we could just write to interact with our readers; that turned out to be only half true. 
 
A few of the skills we learned, or improved on, by managing this blog (we aren’t experts by any means, but it’s a process): 

- Social media engagement
- Networking
- Google Drive
- Blog writing
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

### An Asset to Use for a Job Search

We use this blog on our LinkedIn profiles, Levo profiles, and resumes. It has taught us skills we can use in future jobs. Soft skills we’ve learned are a major asset; our interpersonal skills are constantly developing. Consistent reader interaction, voice/video calls with other bloggers, and collaborations with other bloggers, have opened our eyes to different communication methods. 

### A Way to Improve Your Collaboration Skills

If you write your blog with a friend, you can easily improve your team skills. Learning to work with and around another person’s schedule teaches you how to collaborate in any situation. 
 
Collaborations with other bloggers has a similar effect. We have learned to seek out people we believe would add value to our content. Working with bloggers is always fun and interesting, but also helps you see how to mesh your ideas with others’ to create a unified front, which is sometimes a challenge. Google Drive has been such an asset in those situations. 

### A Creative Outlet

No matter how much you love your work, if you do, having an outlet to do something for yourself is priceless. You are able to do anything you want with your blog, giving you the ability to fulfil yourself however your job doesn’t.

You can use a blog to reach any goal. It’s a professional development tool, an accountability buddy, a practice-what-you-preach motivation, or anything you want it to be. Do you write a blog or do you think you’d like to?
