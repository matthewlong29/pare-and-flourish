The holiday season seems to always teeter between magic and chaos. The Pare and Flourish team is really feeling that right now. We have schedules to keep and unexpected adventures to conquer, which have left us emotional and exhausted. It was a long week, both physically and mentally. That whole what-doesn’t-kill-you-makes-
you-stronger thing had better be true. 

Holidays amplify your everyday life. If something becomes stressful any other time of the year, it seems rough, but during the holidays, it just doesn’t fit. We spend the year thinking of how much we love this time of year. Nothing is supposed to go wrong. Nothing at all.  

Our goal isn't to complain, but rather to reframe our perspective and move through this season with our sanity intact. We’ve put together a few things helping us through. 

## Keep a Semi-Normal Schedule

Our schedules barely qualify as schedules right now. They can be better described as attempts to make sure important things get done. To keep things moving, we’ve made sure to keep a few staples in our “schedules.” 

Even in the hectic days, keep to your staples. For example, for us that’s tea/coffee in the morning (ahem, and afternoon, and other sleepy times of the day).

## Go on a Slight Auto-Pilot

Holiday meals involve a lot of running from one house to another. Running around to meet up with four or more meals is just a lot. Not to mention, talking with family members you haven’t seen since last year, meaning you’ve probably answered classic questions like: “What do you do?” or “When are you going to have kids?” The good, existential crisis provoking questions.

This is a rare occasion where our advice is to not go above and beyond. Choose one of those meals to put effort into. Don’t overextend yourself!

## Make Time for Yourself 

It’s a natural progression. You are busy seeing family and preparing meals, so you aren’t too concerned about whether or not you made time for “me time” this week. This is what leads to a breakdown.

In the hopes to maintain a sense of normalcy here are a few things we try to incorporate during the holidays: 

- Before bed, take 30 minutes to yourself
- Show up a little late; 20 minutes late to a 4 hour gathering will not hurt anyone
- Meditate
- Make time to relax and watch your favorite holiday movie
- Create a schedule
- Ask for help
