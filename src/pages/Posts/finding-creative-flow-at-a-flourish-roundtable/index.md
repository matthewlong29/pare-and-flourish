This past weekend we sat down with an amazing group of women. We learned all about who they are, what their creative passion is, and how they get into “the zone.”

## What is a Flourish Roundtable?

If you haven’t joined a Flourish Roundtable yet, first of all, you should check out the [next one](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/pare-and-flourish-15968312177)! Second, we’ll explain a little more about what it is:

A Flourish Roundtable is how we have redefined professional networking. We call these events networking experiences because of the personal nature. We don’t stand around talking about the weather or what we ate for lunch. 

We invite you gather around a topic that you’re passionate about and use that topic to connect with like-minded women. The conversation isn’t awkward, it’s insightful and meaningful. It’s guided by mediators and is an encouraging environment that everyone will feel comfortable contributing to.  

These events are only for the ladies. Think of a gentlemen’s club, except no scotch, cigars, or gentlemen. Add wine and inspirational women and you’ve got yourself a Roundtable. 

Our newest Roundtables have partnered with local businesses to share the love.

## What is Creative Flow?

We opened the event with wine from our favorite wine bar, [Preservation Tasting Room](http://www.preservationbg.com/home/). Wine really encourages your inner creative. 

The conversation started by defining Creative Flow. Creative flow can also be described as being “in the zone.” The most accurate description, by the way, is:

>“A state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”

## “What is your creative outlet?”

This simple question sparked a lengthy conversation. We heard a variety of answers: creative writing, cake decorating, reading, painting, the list goes on. This conversation quickly took shape. Everyone began to see that we all struggle to fit creativity into our schedules. Even more difficult, we struggle to maintain a sense of creative satisfaction. Curious questions turned into rolls of laughter.

This Flourish Roundtable gave everyone a time and space to really explore their creative side; to be inspired to pick up their creativity when they got home.

We ended our afternoon with henna tattoos by [Sarah Gust](https://www.instagram.com/sarahelizgust/) of [Folksense](http://www.folksense.shop/)—the perfect way to wear our creativity on the outside.
