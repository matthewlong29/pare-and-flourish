You may have seen an advertisement on Facebook, or another platform, for the Shapr app. We did, and asked ourselves how this could impact our professional development. Staying ahead of the curve is important. It doesn’t always have to be difficult, out of reach, or costly. Thanks to technology, we can do most anything on the go. Shapr’s has made the same true for networking. 

Launched in 2015, [Shapr](http://m.onelink.me/b9e940e7) has gained users across the US, Great Britain, and France, largely through word of mouth. It’s no surprise that Shapr’s following continues to grow. It uses an algorithm to match professionals with the people that could potentially change the course of their professional life. The app is designed to help you find people for inspiring conversations, collaborations, or anything you might need to grow personally and professionally.

### How does it work? 

Shapr shows you a picture, location, and brief profile of a person near you that is interested in networking. You decide whether you would like to ‘meet’ or ‘pass’ for each person. To meet, swipe right. To pass, swipe left. It sounds a lot like Tinder for networking, doesn’t it? 

When you have swiped right on a person to meet them and they have also swiped right on you, you can start messaging in the app. For the past month, we’ve been using Shapr to test it out. The results are in. It’s a match!

### Skylar’s Thoughts 

I was leery when I first downloaded [Shapr](http://m.onelink.me/b9e940e7). Apps are difficult for me to keep up with and I didn’t want to devote even more of my time looking at my phone. I downloaded it anyway and started swiping. 

I based my ‘meet’ swipes on the following criteria: 

- Distance from where I live
- How interested I was in their field
- How much of their profile was filled out

During the first few days I matched with a few people here and there. I had a few conversations with a few different matches, but nothing substantial. Until I got a message from [Noah, a website designer and consultant for small businesses](http://hirenoah.com/). 

We had a brief conversation about possibly meeting up when I was in town (he’s located in Nashville, an hour away from where I live). I finally made it to Nashville for work, and Noah was able to meet me at a coffee shop before my other meetings started. 

Noah was a master of networking. He knew all the right questions to ask and before I knew it, half an hour had gone by. We exchanged information and will hopefully have an opportunity to work together in the future. I feel like I made a solid professional connection, all thanks to Shapr.

### What You Should Know About Shapr

First, it’s free. Shapr has given you the opportunity to expand your business without spending a dime (except maybe on delicious coffee during your meetup). 

Second, the algorithm. What does it use to connect you with the right people? The app takes your location, self-selected interests, and professional experience into consideration while looking for your next connection. 

Finally, you are given a personalized selection of ten to fifteen people per day. Shapr is not going to throw random people in the mix just to give you options. Your connections are hand-selected to fit what you need and, possibly, what you didn’t know you were looking for.

### Overall Review

I have nothing but good things to say about Shapr. It has been the perfect way to connect with people who have the same mission I do—expand my professional circle to include likeminded solopreneurs.

You can use this app as casually or as diligently as you like. The more you put in, the more you will get out. Whatever your goal, Shapr can help you find people to make it happen. 

You need Shapr. Trust us, it will not let you down. You can download Shapr for free [here](http://m.onelink.me/b9e940e7). Try it out and let us know what you think. We can’t wait to hear about the connections you’ve made!
