Alice Simpson is passionate about yoga and meditation. She sees them as different petals of the same lotus blossom and has been a practitioner for over 15 years. She understands firsthand the important role they play in a healthy, modern lifestyle. 

Alice’s career in health and human services spanned 35 years, including 5 years as President/CEO of [LifeSkills, Inc.](http://www.lifeskills.com/) She credits her practice with helping her stay fit, manage work stress, and balance career and personal life. Upon retirement, Alice applied her time and energy to the pursuit of yoga education and teaching credentials. She received her [Yoga RYT-200](https://www.yogaalliance.org/Credentialing/For_Teachers/RYT_200) at that time.

Like the lotus growing from the mud, Alice believes that a yoga and meditation practice is transformative. Her favorite quote is by Bhante Gunaratana, author of [Mindfulness in Plain English](https://amzn.to/2FfjVU6), “The purpose of meditation is personal transformation. The you that goes in one side of the meditation experience is not the same you that comes out the other.” 

Along with the extensive training that Alice has received, she credits several mentors and hundreds of hours of self-study with her transformation. Authors like [Jon Kabat-Zinn](https://www.mindfulnesscds.com/), [Eckhart Tolle](https://amzn.to/2Jntd2S), and [Tara Brach](https://www.tarabrach.com/) have nurtured Alice, cultivated her compassion, and bolstered her ability to help others.

Alice believes that each individual has a personal experience with yoga and meditation. She can easily pinpoint the exact moment in 2013 when her practice shifted into a new paradigm. At that time, she became interested in the science behind the practice—Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)—and attended an eight-week program at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Vanderbilt University.

Alice is a lifelong learner who studies the ancient texts and traditions, understands the impact they have on modern life and happiness, and easily guides you through their complexities. She does this by facilitating classroom discussion and answering questions about the practice of yoga, mindfulness, and meditation in simple language. She empowers you to put your practice directly into action. This commitment will not only enrich your life, it will enhance your next [Pare and Flourish roundtable](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/flourish-roundtable-mindfulness-meditation-w-4yoga-tickets-44975573150?aff=affiliate1). 

Alice's approach of “one size does NOT fit all" is especially suited to the diverse nature of Pare and Flourish. Her fresh, open-minded, and skillful guidance will help you find a workable technique, press the pause button on a busy life, pare, and flourish. 

Alice teaches that a well-rounded meditation experience can be a practice, or a lifestyle and you should enjoy the journey. She is looking forward to connecting with you, learning from you, and sharing her knowledge. This flexible approach leads Alice to encourage you to, "Take what you like and leave the rest."

Namaste!
