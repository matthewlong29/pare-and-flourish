**Let’s face it, networking events can be, and usually are, awkward.** They require you to walk into an event with unknown faces, and make awkward small-talk about how unseasonably warm it’s been lately. No one *really* enjoys that, do they? In an attempt to connect women in a way that is meaningful, we started Flourish Roundtables. 

**The goal of a Flourish Roundtable is to create a community for women lean on, ask for advice, and flourish with.** At a Flourish Roundtable, we invite up to 10 women to come together to network in a structured environment. We keep these events small so that each conversation can feel connected with meaningful conversation. The conversation is guided by up to two moderators. The moderators are there to help the conversation flow and encourage participation; they achieve this by asking questions that will spark new ideas and connection. If you haven’t attended a Flourish Roundtable before, you can learn more [here](/events).

We are always looking to collaborate with like-minded women. **Are you interested in co-hosting an event like this?** Whether you’re an individual or part of a business, engage women in your community with a Flourish Roundtable! 

Read on to learn exactly what the role of a co-host is. 

## Gain Interest from Your Friends, Coworkers, and Contacts

As a co-host, we ask that you **share the event with your friends, coworkers, and contacts**. These events only work when there are enough people to network. You have the chance to pull together friends and coworkers that may not have met otherwise. Share the event with friends via **Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and word of mouth.** We’ll be promoting the event alongside you for three weeks prior! 

## Choose a Possible Topic

**Is there a topic dear to your heart?** We generally stick to professional and personal development topics. Here’s a list of prior Flourish Roundtable topics: 

- Self-Care
- Confidence
- Women in the Workforce
- Professional Branding

However, **we encourage you to propose a new topic**! 

## Choose a Possible Venue

We are always on the lookout for new venues in various cities. To keep registration costs low, we strive to find spaces with minimum to no expenses. **We love to partner with local businesses to promote their space.**

Think outside the box! Or inside your favorite venue. 

Locations where we’ve held events in the past: 

- Preservation Tasting Room & Bottle Shop – Bowling Green, KY
- Mariah’s Restaurant – Bowling Green, KY
- Hamburg Farms Apartments – Lexington, KY 
- Jarred Butler State Farm – Elizabethtown, KY
