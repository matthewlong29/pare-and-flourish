## Rise and Shine!

For most of us, the hardest part of the morning is just getting out of bed. Working long hours the day before leaves us longing for just one more hour of sleep. **A great burst of get up and go is to take one drop of Peppermint essential oil on your tongue as soon as the alarm goes off.** This will be a minty burst to get those eyes wide open and will also help to open your airways as you take a few long deep breaths.

**Next, apply a drop or two of doTERRA’s Balance Blend to the bottoms of your feet.** This is a special blend to help ground you emotionally and have you ready to take on the day. It helps to calm anxious feelings and promote full body of relaxation throughout the day.

**For daily focus I apply doTERRA’s blend, In Tune.** This blend is an everyday must have to keep you on track and focused to complete your daily task and deadlines. Rub a little on the back of your neck each morning.

## Afternoon Slump!

Two to three o’clock is usually when we start to feel the energy leaving our bodies, which makes us feel unfocused. **A great way to keep up the drive and energy is to add 1 – 2 drops of Lemon essential oil to water.** Lemon is great to promote energy and detox the body. The aroma of Lemon can not only boost energy but also lift your mood. **Diffuse Peppermint, Wild Orange, and Frankincense essential oils to keep you energized and focused. If you feel little afternoon head tension creeping in, just a little smidge of Peppermint and Lavender essential oil rubbed into your temples should fix you right up.**

## Nighttime Chill!

After a long day of work, we really need to disconnect and decompress from the daily stress before bed. **While you’re recharging from your day, apply 1 drop of doTERRA’s On Guard blend to the bottom of your feet.** This is a great immune support to the body but will also protect the body from negative emotions. **Diffuse Lavender to help relax the body and apply a drop to your chest and bed sheets. Apply 1 drop of doTERRA’s Breathe respiratory blend to your chest.** This will help to open up the airways and help get a more recuperative sleep.

The last tip about rocking your daily routine is self-care. Practicing self care with essential oils will establish habits that will soon become routine. Take care of yourself every day, all day long, and you will begin to see more spunk and energy in your life. Take care, Rockstars!
