Even the words “start a business” are anxiety provoking. Sure, it starts with the exciting feeling of opportunity, and then a bigger reality sets in. Where will you get the money? Do you need a business plan? How do you register an LLC? Or maybe you should become a corporation? How does this affect your taxes?

Yep. Now calm down.

**Let’s explore why you’re scared.** You know, to get it all out of your way. **And then let’s talk about taking a risk that will possibly change your life.**

## Imposter Syndrome

We first learned about imposter syndrome from Sheryl Sandberg’s book [Lean In](http://amzn.to/2hRFUKJ). Actually, we learned what to call those feelings we’ve had all along. Imposter syndrome is when you feel as though if you are recognized for something, someone will discredit you and find out that you are, in fact, a fraud. 

Our imposter syndrome: Who were we to talk about professional development? Were we perfect employees? No. Do we know everything there is to know about our subject? No. 

Did that stop us from sharing our experiences, learning as much as we could, and building something we’re proud of? Absolutely not. 

Don’t let feelings of doubt keep you from creating your dream business.

## Where You will Get the Money?

In our case, we didn’t have the money to build a brick and mortar business. Fine. We created a blog first and started building our online presence. From there, we started reaching out for our [Flourish Roundtable events](/events) and [reviewing job materials](/services) for young professionals. 

Our point: We didn’t have the money. Period. We did what we could with what we had. **You can make it work.**

Consider funding your new business with [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/). 

## Worrying About an llc, bank account, email address, etc.

You. Will. Learn. 

Unless you are somehow well-versed in creating an administrative base for a business, this part of the process may intimidate you. That’s okay. You’ll tackle these tasks one by one and learn a useful skill each time. 

Do your research. The internet has all the information you could possibly need. If you prefer speaking to people rather than doing internet research, set up [informational interviews](/blog/the-networking-worlds-best-kept-secret/) with entrepreneurs in your area.

## Doing it anyway:

### It’s Great Once You Start

hen you take your dream from the idea in your head to reality, it becomes this very real, exciting, terrifying, wonderful thing. Suddenly it’s easier to think of new ideas to improve your business. **When you aren’t distracted by thinking about how you could start your business, you become obsessed with how you could improve it.**

### Watching Progress Happen

**Over time, the things that were once so difficult to you become easier.** It’s almost as if it takes no effort at all. Taking a moment to self-reflect and realize that you’ve come a long way is essential to your success. We aren’t saying you shouldn’t keep working. But, there is something truly satisfying about seeing yourself improve. 

### Having Something to Constantly Dream About

Everyday life can be exhausting. It’s tempting to come home and sit on the couch until time for bed. But, **creating a business sparks this fire inside of you**. You become passionate and inspired to work on it at all hours of the day; dreaming about what could be and what you can do to get there. **Having something to dream about lifts your spirit and changes your perspective on everything.** Having goals keeps us motivated day in and day out.

### Your Friends and Family Will Eventually Recognize it as ‘Real’ 

**Your toughest critics will be your family and friends.** We know, you don’t believe us. That’s okay. But it’s true. To be fair, it’s not their fault; they only want what is best for you. So for a while you must repeatedly explain to them what you are doing and why you are doing it and how you will ever make money. 

There is something so beautiful about the moment when you explain it all to them for the last time. Because something happens and one day they just see it: you aren’t just doing something for fun, you’re creating a life for yourself. And they, too, can see the possibilities. This is the moment when you smile a little inside and do a little “I told you so” dance, and then **you go right back to kicking ass and building your business**.

<hr class="secondary">

This is all to say, no wonder you’re scared. **It’s going to be difficult. However, it’s easier than your mind will let you believe.** Truthfully [prepare yourself for a cliché, if you want it badly enough, you will make it work. 

What business would you love to start working on?
