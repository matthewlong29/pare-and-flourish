We’re in love with local community and, by extension, local business. As consumers, it’s up to us to keep our local businesses well-loved and thriving. The most obvious way to support businesses is to choose them when we shop. But, without constantly spending money, how do we show our support?

We’re waiting for that money tree our parents always talked about to spring up in the backyard. Until that beautiful day, we will be choosing local as often as possible, but we will also:

## 1. Partner with that Business to Reach a Mutual Goal

Partnering is a way to promote a local business while also fulfilling a need. For example, our Flourish Roundtable in January will feature muffins from Elizabethtown’s own [Vibe Coffee](http://www.vibecoffeeshop.com/). We needed food for the event and we want as many people as possible to experience their cozy atmosphere and wonderful [menu](http://www.vibecoffeeshop.com/menu-cm73).

We love Vibe. If we’re in Elizabethtown, any ‘business talks’ to be had about P&F are there. Thanks to them, we have delicious muffins for our next event, and we can show off their baked goods to potentially new customers.

## 2. Refer Friends to the Business

Sometimes a business’ best advertisement is word of mouth. If you love the new coffee shop down the street, tell a friend who may love it too. Besides, a new business in town is always a good conversation starter, or maybe a way to break the ice at your next networking meeting.

## 3. Write a Facebook or Google Review

Simple enough. Right? When you remember… We get it. We’re all busy. Reviewing the amazing brunch restaurant you found isn’t at the top of your to-do list.

So: Take ten minutes (maybe right now?) and review your favorite local places in town on [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/), or [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/). You’ll feel good about promoting local economy, they’ll appreciate your kind words, and people searching online will appreciate your opinion.

There are plenty options for supporting local businesses and, in turn, local economies. You don’t have to constantly spend money to be an advocate for your community.
