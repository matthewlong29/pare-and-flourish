>“Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” - *Henry Ford*

The best time to invest in yourself was yesterday; the next best time is right now. By investing in yourself, we mean taking responsibility in your personal and professional development. This could mean investing time in reading about your field or about workplace improvement. This could also mean spending money on a course or a conference that would help you in your field. Maybe, investing in yourself means taking time to read a book you enjoy before work. 
 
Investing in yourself and your career can seem like too much. You spend forty (plus) hours of your week at work, and you don’t want to spend any time outside of work thinking about your career, much less spending money on it. Or maybe, you feel that it’s your employer’s responsibility to provide you with the professional development tools you’re looking for. The beauty of investing in yourself is that you can do as little or as much as you want, and it all benefits **you**...and your employers, but first and foremost, you.

>**Pro Tip**: You’re never too old, educated, or busy to stop learning. Whether you’re improving on a current skill or learning a new one, it’s time to put yourself first.

Read on to discover three ways that you can invest in yourself:

## 1. Train Yourself

There is always room for some improvement in your skill set. Whatever you do, there’s a training or conference out there for exactly that. Taking the initiative to  improve your performance at your current job has the potential to make your job easier and to help you stand out to your employer. Training is also a good opportunity to learn skills you would like to be doing for your future career. 
 
Continuing education expense can often be reimbursed by your company. Be sure to use this benefit, if it’s available. If it isn’t, choosing to train on your own time shows others that you are self-motivated person who is committed to improvement. Self-improvement is something that no one can take from you; it’s always a sound investment. Not to mention, it looks great on your resume.

## 2. Get Certified In Something New

Learning something new can be good for the soul. When your job is lacking in inspiration, figure out what you’re passionate about, and do some research to determine if you can be certified. This certification could improve your situation by giving you an extra set of skills to climb the corporate ladder. It could also provide just the escape route you need to enter the workforce in a new career. 
 
Certifications say, “I’m qualified to do this” in a way others quickly understand. Your peers now have a way to measure exactly how far you’ve gone and what you know. Being certified can open doors that you weren’t aware existed.

## 3. Spend Time on Your  Hobby

Many of us tend to get caught up in the hustle of our careers. We go to work earlier and stay later just to get a little ahead. We tell ourselves we will have time later. “Later” evolves over time; usually it starts with the notion of tomorrow. Tomorrow turns into next week, next year, and after we retire. 
The time to enjoy yourself is now. You won’t regret investing in your happiness today. 
 
A hobby is a good way to do something for yourself. You're investing in your mental clarity. When so much of our day is work, household chores, and sleep, we need something to keep us balanced. 

>**Pro tip**: Take an hour of your morning for yourself. Use that hour to read, knit, whatever it is that helps you self-actualize to start your day.
