If you’ve found yourself either:
<p class="indent">A. Hoping that your boss sees how awesome you are and rewards you with a huge raise</p>
<p class="indentMore">Or</p>
<p class="indent">B. Hoping that your boss doesn’t remember the time you made a fool of yourself in front of the client</p>
...we have some advice to get you through.

### What to Consider Before an Employee Review

- What have I done this year to contribute to the company’s success?
- What could I improve on?
- What would I change about my job?
- What do I love about my job?


### Be Ready

Think of questions you would like to ask. You don’t always have your employer’s undivided attention, so now is the time. This is your moment to ask about salary, job growth, and the direction of the company. 
 
Write down a list of wants, needs, and questions to take with you to the review. You will look prepared...because you will be. 

### Be Honest

If your boss asks you if you are happy with your job as it is, don’t lie. Maybe you love your job; tell them that. Maybe you would change something; tell them that too. Lying is not going to help either party.

### Be Positive

Never assume that your boss won’t be receptive to what you want to say. Reviews are to help everyone stay on the same page. You will not be penalized for asking for a raise, a better workspace, or a different schedule. They can say no, but they could also say yes. 
 
It’s easy to get caught up in what bothers us about our jobs, but we should always focus on what we love about our jobs as well. This is a great venue to tell your boss how much you appreciate the work they do and how that contributes to your success.

### Be Confident

There’s nothing like an upcoming employee review to rattle your self-esteem. You know you do a good job, but can’t shake the feeling that your boss has been watching all those times you just couldn’t get motivated. Here’s a secret: your boss is also a human; he/she does not expect you to have super-human abilities. No one can be at 100% every day. 
 
To combat those feelings, make a list of the accomplishments you’ve made over the last quarter or year. Understand the value of those things and how they’ve helped the company. Seeing a list of the reasons you are an asset will boost your confidence and give you something to talk about when it’s time to talk salary. 

### Be Goal Oriented

We’re not perfect. There will always be things we could improve about our performance, no matter how great it is already. It never hurts to show your boss that you identify your own shortcomings and have a solid plan to improve next year. Don’t enter into a self-deprecating territory, but a healthy dose of self-awareness will show your boss that you are ready to take your work to the next level.
