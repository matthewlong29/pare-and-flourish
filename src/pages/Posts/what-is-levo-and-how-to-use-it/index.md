Levo is like LinkedIn’s fun sibling. Its platform is professional at heart, while emphasizing your personal flare. Relatable. Helpful. Attractive. It’s everything you didn’t know you wanted in a professional networking site. 

<hr class="secondary">

Levo wants to “showcase the real you.” Your profile prompts you to not list job responsibilities, but rather to explain why you love what you do. Instead of using a logo for a company photo, you’re free to post a picture of your [adorable coworkers](https://www.levo.com/skylar-wooden) dressed as Alice in Wonderland characters. 

Choosing your colors and pictures is oddly reminiscent of building your MySpace profile, in only the best ways, of course. Levo gives you a space to be who you are, without throwing professionalism out the door.

### You’re More than Your Job Title

At times, we identify ourselves by our professions. Levo lets us identify by our lives in a well-rounded approach. You’re able to discuss your accomplishments alongside photos of your [recent trip to Greece](https://www.levo.com/945640), explaining how traveling has changed your perspective.
