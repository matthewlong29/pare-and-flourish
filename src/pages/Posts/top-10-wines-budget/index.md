It’s that time of year again! No, not Christmas. The time of year when you can unapologetically buy wine in bulk for “the holidays.” You have a short window in November and December when no one can look twice when you buy a case from the liquor store. Not that we don’t support this at any point during the year. Christmas in July’s a thing, right? 

Wine is expensive. But, after finishing countless bottles that are overpriced and underwhelming, you start to develop a knack for choosing the best ones on a budget. 

Just in time for the holidays, we’ve put together a list of our favorites (starting at the sweetest and ending at the driest), all of which are under $20.

    <h3>1. Purple Toad, Black and Bruised</h3>
    <p>We could hardly call ourselves Kentuckians if we didn’t start with a Kentucky wine. Made in Paducah, Purple Toad is as sweet as it comes. A blended blackberry and blueberry wine perfect for an after dinner drink.</p>

    <h3>2. Wildside Winery, Cranberry</h3>
    <p>Cranberry is the pumpkin spice of Thanksgiving. This Kentucky wine, made Versailles, Kentucky, is sure to put you in the holiday spirit. If you’re in the Lexington or Louisville area, you can get this at the local Liquor Barn. If not, call and order a bottle!

    <h3>3. Cupcake, Moscato D’asti</h3>
    <p>Hardly wine. Sparkling alcoholic juice. Perfect for Thanksgiving dinner with family members who say your dry red tastes like turpentine. True story.</p>

    <h3>4. Primo Amore, Moscato</h3>
    <p>Truthfully, we’ve stumbled across this one thanks to Olive Garden, and we loved it! It is a sweet and bubbly white that will pair perfectly with turkey.</p>

    <h3>5. Dolciando Rosso Dolce, Sweet Red</h3>
    <p>Two wines were served at Katie’s wedding. This was one of two. It was a huge hit. Guests asked about the brand all night. From us to you, try it. This sweet red will definitely impress your guests.</p>

    <h3>6. Barefoot, Pinot Grigio</h3>
    <p>If you’ve been around a college girl, you’ve seen Barefoot. You probably also know that it’s the college girl’s drink-of-choice because it’s cheap. Don’t let that fool you. It’s a pretty <a href="https://www.barefootwine.com/our-wine/detail/pinot-grigio-wine">solid dry white</a>. You can also use it in holiday sangria recipes like <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/595530750695343522/">this one</a>.</p>

    <h3>7. Apothic Red, Winemaker’s Blend</h3>
    <p>If you’re looking for a red but aren’t sure what you’re in the mood for, a blend is the way to go. Apothic has a lot of great reds, but the blend is our favorite!</p>

  <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
    <h3>8. Handcraft, Pinot Noir</h3>
    <p>This has been Skylar’s go-to wine for the past two years, or so. For those looking to ease into dry reds, this is the one. Handcraft has a smooth, full taste that never disappoints. When you find the perfect red for you, you stick with it.</p>

  <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6">
    <h3>9. Dark Horse, Cabernet Sauvignon</h3>
    <p>Featured at a recent friendsgiving dinner, Darkhorse was a hit. Finding a good, cheap cab is difficult (coincidentally, we have two on this list). This one’s hints of brown spice and dark chocolate espresso will blow you away.</p>

    <h3>10. Carnivor, Cabernet Sauvignon</h3>
    <p>We once paid too much for a bottle of this at a wine bar. 150% markup. That said, it was great. Smooth. Bold. The whole package. Buy it at a liquor store, not a fancy wine bar.</p>

If you find yourself surrounded by people who don't appreciate wine this holiday season, you should reevaluate your surroundings. When someone offers you a beer, you keep right on drinkin’ your pinot.
