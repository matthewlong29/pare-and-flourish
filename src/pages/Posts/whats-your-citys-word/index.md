    <p>We are a bit behind on the trend, but our latest read was Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert. If you’ve been following along on our blog and our instagram, then you know that one-half of the P and F duo, Skylar, has been in France for the last 7 months. In preparation for the one week that we would be in France together, we started listening to this book.</p>
    <p>As it turns out, we were perfectly capable of catching up, drinking wine, and making crepes. No book was necessary. </p>

Throughout the book, Gilbert brings up the concept that every city and every person has a word. The idea being that this word would completely describe that person or city. For example, Gilbert proposed that Rome’s word is ‘sex’, New York’s word is ‘achieve’, The Vatican’s word is ‘power’. 

What is the point of this? The ability to define your city, or yourself, in one word is no small feat. Truly knowing yourself is difficult. Moving beyond that to find one word that can capture all of its essence is even harder. We challenge you to think on it, or in true Elizabeth Gilbert fashion, to meditate on it.

As Pare and Flourish gets more and more involved in the community, we ask the questions:  What is the word for Bowling Green? What is the word for Elizabethtown? 

We’ve given it some thought. The words we’ve come up with:

### Elizabethtown, KY: Growth

Elizabethtown is not the same city that we remember 10 years ago. It’s changed in some dramatic ways in the last few years. From the change of scenery on the square, to the change on Ring Rd, one word that comes to mind first is ‘growth’. Etown, as we lovingly know it to be, has grown so much. And we are so excited to see where it continues to. 

### Bowling Green, KY:  Community

Bowling Green’s community-oriented spirit is evident wherever you look. Live music is playing every weekend. Farmer’s markets are buzzing on Saturday mornings. Local restaurants are always introducing new, locally-sourced foods. Festivals and charity events are always being organized. Bowling Green is so alive because the community is alive. We love being a part of that community.

We challenge you to think of your word for your city. What is the word that describes your city? 

You can also choose a “word” for yourself. What is a word that completely describes you? 

Or maybe for your business. For our business, we choose the word ‘flourish’. Get it?
