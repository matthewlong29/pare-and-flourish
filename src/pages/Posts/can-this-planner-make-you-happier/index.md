Think back to your school-shopping days: the excitement of choosing new notebooks, binders, and pens. It seems bizarre now to think of how excited we were to shop for new school supplies. But, can you honestly say that you don’t get that same rush from buying new pens and a planner? 

It’s a symbol of something new, something great. The crisp, unmarked pages symbolize a new start. A new semester, a new job, a new outlook. As sappy as it sounds, you buy a planner because you’re ready for a new beginning. You promise yourself that you are starting this new journey—whatever it may be—on the right note. 

In September, **the Happiness Planner** gave us that feeling. It was a new chapter in our lives, so it was only appropriate that we find a tool to make it count.

Can the Happiness Planner make you happier? We think so.

## The Happiness Roadmap

Starting with the Happiness Roadmap, you answer questions about your priorities and feelings. The roadmap is a place for you to reflect on what you’re grateful for, what you’re proud of, what lessons you’ve learned, and how you define success. This is the perfect start to the planner because it guides you through your priorities and goals. You use this info you’ve learned about yourself to inform your daily entries and weekly goals. 

Our favorite part of this section was analyzing what makes us happy and unhappy. The planner asks you to write what makes you happy, rate it on a scale of 1 – 10 (based on how happy it makes you), and then decide how often you should do it. The same goes for unhappy: you write what makes you unhappy, rate it, decide whether or not you can change it and how. 

Each section of the Happiness Roadmap helps you discover something about yourself. You already know the answers, but you aren’t aware of those answers. Discover what is waiting under your surface.

## Weekly Plan

Now that you’ve learned more about what you want to achieve in the next 100 days, you’re ready to create your first weekly plan. You know your overall goals, but how will you get there? You have the opportunity to sit down and decide exactly what you want out of this week. You’re also able to write down the main events of the week, giving you time to plan. Preparation helps you see what is important and which days you have opportunities to work toward your goals.

## Daily Entries

These are the most helpful parts of the planner. The daily entries (which we suggest you add to your morning routine) are a place to add practical items, like your to do list, but also a place to add less tangible thoughts, like ‘today I’m excited about...’

Your daily entries are a perfect way to add mindfulness to your morning. Start your day by envisioning the possibilities. What will you accomplish? What kind of exercise will you do? What are you grateful for? These entries ask all the right questions.

## Weekly Reflection

“Reflection” is really a good way to describe every section of this journal. Your weekly reflection, though, is a time for you to decide how your week went versus your expectations. You start by describing your week in three words and then rate how you feel on a scale of 1 – 5. You go on to describe your highs, lows, what you learned, what you’re grateful for, and what you hope for next week. 

Your weekly reflection gives you the chance to evaluate your week and set your course for the next.
