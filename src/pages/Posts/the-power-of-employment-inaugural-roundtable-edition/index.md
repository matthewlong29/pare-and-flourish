“What does your perfect day look like?” We asked that question to seven women. Sitting around a table, most holding a glass of wine with a half smile. As they thought of their “perfect day” (which was void of restriction), you could see smiles forming. The kind that starts at the eyes and works its way down. On a Saturday afternoon, free from worry, with a glass of wine in their hands, these women imagined what they wanted their future life to be like.

One by one, each woman gave us a version of their “perfect day.” They ranged from cooking and exercise to tea drinking and fiction reading. No matter how ambitious or relaxing the days were, they were truly all perfect. We continued the conversation by finding ways these women could incorporate pieces of their fiction perfect day into their very real, busy lives. 

We spent the rest of the discussion talking about what they loved and didn’t love about their lives or careers. Exploring the highs and lows of being a millennial woman in the modern workforce was eye opening. We were all able to see that some of what we were dealing with in our own lives, others were going through the same. We also realized that some of the women had similar interests that brought the group closer.

This enlightening discussion about hope, ambition, strength, and weakness, helped us see each of these women for who they were and who they strived to be. Women are so very powerful, and it was extremely clear during that discussion that we are more powerful together. 

If you’ve ever wanted to be a part of something bigger than yourself, something that makes you feel connected to someone based on more than your common interests, but on your common beliefs and feelings, this is the place for you. A Flourish Roundtable events creates that connection. And we are so honored to facilitate that connection. We can’t wait to see you there.
